5281,Hopless beer Cycle 2,"During the brewing process, S. cerevisiae converts the fermentable sugars in grains into ethanol and a host of other flavor determining by-products. Flowers of the hop plant, Humulus lupulus, are added at specific points during the brewing process and are rich in various terpenes, a class of metabolites that impart hoppy flavor and fragrance to beer.
